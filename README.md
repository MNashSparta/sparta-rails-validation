# sparta-rails-validation

This repo was created for a homework for the Sparta bootcamp.

The aim of this homework was to demonstrate my understanding of validation techniques used in Ruby on Rails.

In this project, users could only be created if they entered a name, email, and address. Moreover, the email had to be unique and was checked against a regex to make sure that it was a valid format and from the domain "spartaglobal.com".

I also created a model for Computers, which allowed for the creation of a new computer as long as the user entered a name, availability, colour, and serial number. The serial number was also checked to be unique and that it followed a set standard using a regex.
